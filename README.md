## py_scripts

As like it's name this repo contains python scripts written or collected by me.
The scripts are random created for doing various work.

### pro.py

This script is a sqlmap tamper script created to bypass normal wafs like modsecurity and so on.

### mail_url_number.py

This script is like a website parser. It fetches emails,numbers and links from any given urls and save as a file.

The usage of the script is simple. 

` python3 mail_url_number.py -u url `
 or
` python3 mail_url_number.py `
